# Advent of Code 2025, Day 12

The last puzzle of 2025 has a twist. If you look closely at the few shapes inside the input
data, you can see or feel that there is (almost?) no possibility for shapes to share space.

The solution can be found by only checking basic space requirements, complex rotating and
fitting is not needed required for the puzzle data.

- `aoc-2025-12a.py`: the simple solution
- `aoc-2025-12a-full.py`: really try to fit all the puzzles in the regions (takes about 12 minutes)
- `rust_day12`: the same algorithm but in rust (takes less than a minute)

The easter egg of day 12: "I need to throw in a puzzle like this occasionally to keep
everyone on their toes, right?"
